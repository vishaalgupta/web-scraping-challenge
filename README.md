# web-scraping-challenge

# I first created a notebook where I scraped 4 different websites for data on Mars using BeautifalSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

# I thenk created a flask application where I saved the information I scraped for the notebook in a MongoDB collection and then diplayed that data on an html page.
